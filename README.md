Some informations about me:

I'm a 18 years old pretty boy who lives in Brazil and likes playing games (of course, nerd), watching TV series or Netflix, watches some animes too, likes cartoons, and wishes to 
be a spetacular programmer. My favorite movie is Scott Pilgrim vs. The Universe, I like chicken sausage a LOT, and I love playing basketball. My experience with programming is 
pretty much basic, but I'm in my software engineering degree, so I learned Calango, which is a language that we use here in Brazil, and now I'm learning C, but i also catched up a
little bit with Python, but i can't remember too much from it. Basically, I wish to be happy, and I wish to innovate the software scenario, even if it is just a thing that is so 
little that just one kid will be able to notice. For me, if one person is happy, my job will be complete.
